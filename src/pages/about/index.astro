          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Fox Mortuary Services, LLC is an Ohio-based licensed funeral trade establishment
          that has been serving funeral homes across Northwest Ohio, Southern Michigan, and
          Northeast Indiana for over 30 years. We specialize in providing comprehensive
          professional services to funeral industry professionals, not the general public.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Our approach is built on a simple but powerful commitment: the owner and full-time
          staff of Fox Mortuary Services personally perform all embalming, preparation,
          restoration, and related services. This ensures consistent quality and professional
          care in either our Ohio-licensed facility or at client funeral homes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-forest-800 mt-12 mb-6">
          Our Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We recognize that funeral service by its very nature is as varied as the individuals
          served in each community. This understanding guides our work and shapes our commitment
          to adaptability and excellence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Unlike other livery or transport services in Northwest Ohio, we guarantee that our
          experienced team will handle your embalming, preparation, restoration, and related
          services. This personal touch is what sets us apart and ensures the quality you
          expect for the families you serve.
        </p>
